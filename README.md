# Code for my PhD

This repository is intended to host the code I will write throughout my PhD, including simulations & analytical solutions. 
This is a first atttempt to organize and track my code for my whole PhD studies, but I expect it might be split into multiple repositories as the project thickens and the codes diversify.
